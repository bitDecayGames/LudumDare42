# LD42 Game Ideas

## Territory

* Build the largest boarder and contain the most amount of space
** invest in different skill trees
** manage resources
** possible multiplayer/AI

* Carcasson is similar to capturing territory

## Zoom in/Walls closing in

The zoomin that happens at the end of Mario where you are trying to complete some task before the your movement space is completely limited

## Farming

Rabits live on the farm, you have to do stuff without hurting the rabbits.  Rabbits multiply which limits your mobility/usable space.  Goal is maybe highscore, or maybe the town needs a certain amount of food.  Crops that are higher risk or higher reward.  Certain crops/skills that could move the rabbits around.

## Overcooked

Manuevering around the space in order to accomplish micro-goals.  The space starts to deteriorate.

## Golfing over it

* Starts out really easy, and then becomes harder to maneuver around.  Like golfing over it, but you could stick to things.  Less "space" to stick to as you are trying to make your way through the level.
* Every time you shoot your ball, the ball gets bigger so you can't fit through things
* Black hole on the side of the screen starts to suck in the level behind you, turns it into a timed golfing over it
